#Find My Sasquatch

https://mysterious-fortress-64673.herokuapp.com/

Find My Sasquatch is an app for sasquatch enthusiasts to connect and share information about possible sasquatch sightings. For skeptics it may be viewed as a comical take on the long disputed existence of bigfoot.

###Goal

The goal of the app is to provide a platform for those interested in sasquatch sightings. Users will have the ability to browse through sightings from different locations and also post their own sighting once they are registered on the site. Once registered users can also update their profile and comment on other member posts.

###Approach

* Plan out detailed database relationships
* Use high-fidelity wireframes as guides for the look and feel of the site
* Build the back-end logic
* Implement photo upload functionality

###Technologies Used

Ruby, HTML5, CSS

###Ruby Gems:

* sinatra
* httparty
* carrierwave
* fog
* pry

###Future Improvements
In the future I would like to implement a legitimate meter (like button) functionality, a search bar that can handle broader user input and create more detailed user profiles.
